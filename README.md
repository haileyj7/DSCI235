# DSCI235 Final Project
Representation is a hot topic right now, and many pushes are being made to diversify the
entertainment industry and represent different identities more often and in better ways. One
measure of inclusivity that has gained much traction is the Bechdel Test, which started from a
comic strip by Alison Bechdel in 1985.

For a film to “pass” the Bechdel Test, it must (1) have two named female characters, who
(2) talk to each other, and (3) the conversation can’t be about a man. This only needs to happen
once for a film to pass completely, and it is by no means an exhaustive measure of how
‘feminist’ a movie is. Giving movies scores based on the Bechdel Test is only an attempt to show
if a movie passes basic criteria for having female characters present who don’t solely exist to
support/advance male characters. I want to explore this topic in my project because I want to
learn more about the history of and patterns within the representation of women in entertainment,
through the subset of Bechdel scored movies. Some of the questions I intend to answer include:

* How have bechdel score rates changed over time?
* Do bechdel scores have an influence on ratings or ROI?
* Do movies with lower/higher budgets have lower/higher bechdel scores? What does this say about representation in more 'mainstream' movies?

I will attempt to answer these questions using Pandas with groupby and different visualizations. My project can be found in the file final_assignment.ipynb.
